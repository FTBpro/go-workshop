TODO: Rewrite


# welcome
This is a step-by-step tutorial for creating a simple web server and client. 
You will first build a server with couple of routes, then you will connect a client which will call the server for applying different methods, and after it you will implement a basic router which will make things a bit more easier,

## How to use this repo
This workshop has ____ parts, each part has a different branch with TODOs in the code. Each part has the solution under branch with the same name, with a `-solution` suffix. 

Each part continue the work from the previous one, and for each there is a document that describes and explain the details farther.
